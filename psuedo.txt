Pseudocode

Greet the players and create a new game with two players (Display empty board)
For creating two players, ask for player 1's name and player 2's name. Use these names throughout.

Player One is ALWAYS X while player two is ALWAYS O

1st turn is player 1, who puts the X in ONE square
2nd turn is player 2, who puts the O in ONE square
Two players cannot fill the same square

Cycle continues until one player has a winning combination or they draw

Winning combinations are: Top row, bottom row, middle row, left column, right column, middle column, diagonal left to right
and diagonal right to left.

If there are no winning combinations, the two players draw.

Create 3 classes, the Board class, the Game class and the Player class.


Player Class

Methods: 

1. Initialize - Initialize the marker type for each player

2. Get the coordinates of the marker. Should be a loop. Break the loop if the coordinates exist and coordinates are empty.
     Display an error message if 
     a) the coordinates are not of valid format
     b) the coordinates do not exist
     c) the coordinates already have a marker

Board Class

Methods:

1. Initialize the board as a data structure

2. Render the board

3. Visually place the piece onto the board on the co-ordinates if valid. Display error messages if the coordinates are 
either invalid or are taken

4. Check for a winning combination. Winning combinations are: 

    a) Top row, bottom row, middle row, 
    b) Left column, right column, middle column, 
    c) Diagonal left to right and diagonal right to left.

5. Check for a full board (for a draw). This is if every single row is taken.
